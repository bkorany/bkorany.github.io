<h3> 1. Stationary Crowd Counting using WiFi signals [UCSB, 2021]: </h3>
<!-- <a href="Mobisys21 sample.rar" target="_blank">Sample</a>
<br> -->
In this project, we investigate  the problem of counting a stationary crowd using the ambient WiFi signals, measured on off-the-shelf devices. As opposed to traditional crowd counting methods, which rely on all people in the area to constantly walk/move, stationary crowd counting is a relatively difficult problem due to the lack of major motion information. This project has resulted in one paper in ACM MobiSys '21 (acceptance rate = 21.5%).<br>

In this project, I: 
<ul>
<li><p>  Developed a new and rigorous mathematical model to describe the fidgeting of stationary people. A fidget describes the small in-place motion that a stationary person is frequently involved in (such as pose adjustments). </p>
<li><p>  Proposed a method to estimate the number of people in an area based on their collective fidgeting behavior, inspired by old queuing theory problems.</p>
<li><p>  Experimentally validated our proposed approach by counting up to 10 people in 4 different areas, showing that the counting error is 0 or 1 only for 93.6% of the time. </p>
</ul>

<h3> 2. Nocturnal Seizure Detection using WiFi signals [UCSB, 2020]: </h3>
In this project, we investigate  the problem of detecting nocturnal seizures in epilepsy patients, since they pose a high risk for the patients due to being unnoticed by the caregivers. Hence, we propose to invasively use the ambient WiFi signals near the patient to detect their nocturnal sleep movements and decide whether they are seizures or normal. This project has resulted in one paper in <a href="Papers/IoT21_KoranyMostofi.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE IoT '21</a>.<br>

In this project, I: 
<ul>
<li><p>  Developed a new and rigorous mathematical model to describe the WiFi signals measured on a device near a sleeping patient during different kinds of sleep motions. </p>
<li><p>  Proposed a WiFi processing pipeline to detect these nocturnal motions and classify them into seizures and normal movements.</p>
<li><p>  Experimentally validated our proposed approach using simulated seizures from 20 actors, showing that our proposed framework can detect 94% of nocturnal seizures, with a very low probability of false alarm. </p>
</ul>


<h3> 3. Translating Videos to Instant RF Signals for Training RF Sensing Systems [UCSB, 2020]: </h3> 


In this project, we investigate  how vision data (e.g. video footage) can be used to generate instant RF signals for the purpose of training RF sensing systems. We propose, for the first time, a WiFi sensing system for gym activity classification by only using online available videos from YouTube. We published this work in <a href="Papers/IMWUT20_CaiKoranyKaranamMostofi.pdf" target="_blank">ACM IMWUT '20</a>. 

In this project, we: 
<ul>
<li><p>  Proposed a method that enables training RF sensing systems with zero RF training data and by only using the available online video footage. </p>
<li><p>  Showed how vision data can be translated to the RF domain.</p>
<li><p>  Trained a WiFi sensing system for gym activity classification by only using online available videos from YouTube.</p>
<li><p>  Extensively tested the proposed pipeline with several experiments.</p>
</ul>

<h3> 4. Through-wall Person Identification with WiFi Signals [UCSB, 2019]: </h3>
In this project, we investigate the problem of using WiFi to identify a person walking behind a wall from a candidate video footage. Such a technique can be used in many several real-world applications, such as security, surveillance, and personalized service provisioning. This project has resulted in two papers in <a href="Papers/MobiCom19_KoranyKaranamCaiMostofi.pdf" target = "_blank">ACM MobiCom '19</a> and <a href="Papers/IoT20_KoranyCaiMostofi.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE IoT '20</a>. More information about this project can be found in the <a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/IdentificationThroughWalls">project page</a>.<br>

In this project, we: 
<ul>
<li><p>  Introduced XModal-ID: a novel system that uses WiFi to determine if a person walking behind a wall is the same as one walking in a given video footage. </p>
<li><p>  Extended the proposed WiFi-based identification system to simultaneously identify multiple people through walls based on their gaits and Angles-of-Arrival.</p>
<li><p>  Extensively validated the proposed framework with several experiments by showing how WiFi cards of laptops can identify people through walls.</p>
</ul>

<h3> 5. Human tracking using WiFi signal power [UCSB, 2019]: </h3>
In this project, we investigate  the problem of simultaneously tracking single or multiple people walking in a WiFi-covered area. We propose a Particle-Filter-based solution to achieve this task using only the received WiFi signal power, which can be easily measured on off-the-shelf WiFi devices.  This project has resulted in two papers in <a href="Papers/IPSN18_KaranamKoranyMostofi.pdf" target = "_blank">ACM IPSN '18</a>, <a href="Papers/IPSN19_KaranamKoranyMostofi.pdf" target="_blank">ACM IPSN '19</a>.<br>
In this project, we: 
<ul>
<li><p>  Proposed a particle-filter-based algorithm to track a single person using the WiFi received power.  </p>
<li><p>  Extended the tracking algorithm to track multiple-people simultaneously using 3 laptops.</p>
</ul>

<h3> 6. Angle-of-Arrival Estimation Using only Signal Magnitude [UCSB, 2018]: </h3>
In this project, we investigate  the traditional problem of estimating the Angles-of-Arrival (AoAs) of multiple sources, but using only the received signal's magnitude information.  This project has resulted in a paper in <a href="Papers/IPSN18_KaranamKoranyMostofi.pdf" target = "_blank">ACM IPSN '18</a>.<br>

In this project, we: 
<ul>
<li><p>  Demonstrated that AoA estimation using only signal magnitude is possible, without signal phase.  </p>
<li><p>  Mathematically related AoA to power spectrum content and developed antenna array design strategy. </p>
<li><p>  Experimentally validated approach using a robot to synthesize arrays and measure WiFi magnitude </p>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> 6. Device-to-Device (D2D) Communications Underlaying Massive MIMO Networks [Cairo University, 2015]: </h3>
In this project, we explore different power allocation strategies for D2D communications underlaying Massive MIMO networks. We also explore the base station precoder design for ensuring certain QoS constraints for D2D communications.  This project has resulted in a paper in <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7127643/" target = "_blank">IEEE WCNC '15</a> and a paper in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-016-1379-8" target = "_blank">Springer Wireless Networks '18</a>.<br>

In this project, we: 
<ul>
<li><p>  Demonstrated that AoA estimation using only signal magnitude is possible, without signal phase.  </p>
<li><p>  Mathematically related AoA to power spectrum content and developed antenna array design strategy. </p>
